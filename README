This keeps the infrastructure that builds docker images for [GraphDB|http://graphdb.ontotext.com/]

Note that to use the docker images, you must get a license from us first.

Currently there are no public images for GraphDB Free and you will have to build those if needed from the zip distribution that you get after registering on our website.
